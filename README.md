<p align ='left'>Hey! I'm Erika. I am a recent graduate of TripleTen's Business Intelligence Analytics program. During the program we focused on advanced spreadsheets, SQL, Tableau, and Microsoft Power BI. I am eager to apply the skills that I have learned throughout my program to assist businesses and help them increase growth and drive sales!

I’m passionate about working with small to mid-size businesses starting their own journeys with data analytics and helping them use it to drive engagement and increase growth. My experience working in event planning has given me substantial experience in project management, problem-solving, small business networking, and organizational skills. Since September 2023, I’ve been enrolled in Triple-Ten’s Business Intelligence program, where I’ve developed skills in SQL, data visualization and analysis, and data-driven business solutions.
